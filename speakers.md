Potential speakers at the 2021 Conference

### Rachel Slaybaugh

Prof. Slaybaugh's research is based in numerical methods for neutron transport with an emphasis on supercomputing. She applies these methods to reactor design, shielding, and nuclear security and nonproliferation. Prof. Slaybaugh teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in numerical methods for neutron transport and in nuclear reactor theory. She is also involved in teaching software carpentry skills to scientists and engineers. Slaybaugh was a key founder of the nuclear innovation bootcamp, which seeks to train students and professionals in skills essential to innovation in nuclear energy while executing team projects. Finally, Slaybaugh has served as a Program Director at ARPA-E, developing and running their first fission energy programs. (from her website)
Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy  (ARPA-E) invests in research for ways to generate, use, and store energy. These projects have the potential to radically improve economic prosperity in the U.S. and environmental wellbeing. Thus, we believe that Rachel's goals are aligned with the goals of this conference and would make her an excellent addition to the program. 


### Jim Conca

Jim has many years of experience working in a variety of scientific areas. Now he is a writer for Forbes magazine on topics related to energy and technology. His capacity for scientific communication would make him a grea addition to the conference program.
