\subsection{Socials}

\subsubsection{Barn Dance: A Proud Midwestern Tradition}
Barn dances are a staple event at UIUC. Socialize in a unique environment with games of corn-hole and other midwestern fun. Various barns are used for dancing and mingling by many of the student organizations on UIUC campus, such as Farm Lake barn which hosts dozens of barn dances annually. Conference attendees will be encouraged to dress up in country-style attire or costume for this Thursday evening event. Like socials in the past student conferences, the barn may be used and a third party service can be hired to bring the square dance, swing dance, two step and cowboy boogie to the barn dance floor!

\subsubsection{77 Club at Memorial Stadium}
Memorial Stadium is not only home to the Fighting Illini football team, but also to exquisite event space overlooking Zuppke Field. The sixth level of Memorial Stadium is home of the magnificent 77 Club, which honors Illini great, the ``Galloping Ghost'' Red Grange. This 5,020 square foot space is located midfield and features an outdoor patio area overlooking the city of Champaign, for a combined total space of 9,740 square feet. This event will take place following dinner at I Hotel Conference Center, and is just a short and scenic walk away past the State Farm Center (formerly the historic Assembly Hall). Tables will be set up around a stage featuring live music and a dance floor and drinks will be served, along with hosting raffles with nuclear and Illinois trivia. This is the perfect event to incorporate a little bit of Illinois history with music, dancing, and socializing!

\subsubsection{Bars in the Downtown Champaign District} 
The downtown Champaign area on the north-east block of University Ave. and Neil St. offers a selection of casual, approachable, and fun bars for 21+ guests of Illinois who wish to spend the night out rather than attend the Illini Union Rec Room. Reservations will be made in advance and several bars can accompany up to 100 patrons or more in the area. Some of the recommended bars that the conference planning committee recommend that would be great sponsorship opportunities are Pour Bros. Taproom (up to 100 guest reservation), Guido's Bar and Grill (private lower level space that seats up to 100 with a capacity of 230), and Barrelhouse 34 (has a cozy rooftop lounge if weather permits). Conveniently, the recommended bars are just a couple of blocks from each other, and transportation will be available to get people to and from the downtown Champaign area to the Illini Union.
