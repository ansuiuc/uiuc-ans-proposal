	$\textbf{General Co-Chair - Sam Dotson}$\\
Sam graduated with a B.S. in Physics from UIUC in 2019. He attended his first ANS student conference in April 2019 and was so inspired by his experience that he decided to pursue graduate work in nuclear engineering rather than physics. Now he does research on machine learning applications and computational reactor physics with Dr. Kathryn Huff in the ARFC group. Hosting a student conference that will inspire others the way he was inspired is one of his top priorities this year. He has experience planning activities for student organizations such as Guidance for Physics Students (GPS) and has experience fundraising for the College of Lake County (CLC). He helped set a record amount of donations at the 2016 CLC Foundation Gala, where he was an invited speaker and volunteer. He will be attending the ANS National conference in November 2019, as well as the ANS Student Conference 2020 at North Carolina State University.
