$\textbf{General Co-Chair - Sam Dotson}$\\
Sam graduated with a B.S. in Physics from UIUC in 2019. He attended his first ANS student conference in April 2019 and was so inspired by his experience that he decided to pursue graduate work in nuclear engineering rather than physics. Now he does research on machine learning applications and computational reactor physics with Dr. Kathryn Huff in the ARFC group. Hosting a student conference that will inspire others the way he was inspired is one of his top priorities this year. He has experience planning activities for student organizations such as Guidance for Physics Students (GPS) and has experience fundraising for the College of Lake County (CLC). He helped set a record amount of donations at the 2016 CLC Foundation Gala, where he was an invited speaker and volunteer. He will be attending the ANS National conference in November 2019, as well as the ANS Student Conference 2020 at North Carolina State University.\\

$\textbf{Technical Co-Chair - Jeremy Mettler}$\\

[All committee members must plan on attending the upcoming student conference!]


\subsection{Conflict Resolution}

Committee members should hold professionalism at the forefront of their composure in order to avoid and resolve issues amicably without the involvement of higher powers. As such, members are encouraged to settle conflicts without invoking this protocol. If an issue arises that immediately presents itself as overwhelming, the scope of the issue exceeds an individualâ€™s ability to handle it, or the issue imposes certain implications that jeopardizes the mission of the planning committee, members should not hesitate to refer to this section. In the event of a conflict between members of the planning committee, a document for decision-making and
conflict resolution has been drafted and approved by the general committee. All General Committee members
are expected to abide by the resolution. Key points of the resolution are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Subcommittees are encouraged to operate as autonomous and democratic as possible; however, the General
	Co-Chairs reserve the rights to make all final decisions. If the Co-Chairs cannot agree, the faculty advisor will be involved.
	\item Conflicts between committee members are to be resolved outside of the committee. Should this begin to
	affect the work of these members, the General Co-Chairs may intervene.
	\item Any cases of misconduct or negligence will be handled by the General Co-Chairs as necessary.
	\item For extreme cases of misconduct or negligence, separate steps for the removal and replacement of a
	member are outlined for general members, Subcommittee Chairs, and General Co-Chairs. These include
	a discussion with the offending member, consultation of the Faculty Advisor, and a hearing with the
	General Committee to decide if removal is necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Staffing Requirements}
Staffing for room breakdowns and setups, registration, socials, workshops, tours, etc.  will be supplied by either UIUC ANS members or students of the NPRE department. While it is likely that members of our student chapter will voluntarily fill all the staffing requirements of conference hosted events. If not, we will rely on other student organizations for support including, but not limited to: ACDIS and WIE. Participating in conference events on a staff level is a beneficial experience for any undergraduate who wants to become more familiar with ANS or support their ANS Chapter. Throughout the conference, interacting with registering students, driving groups to tour a scientific facility, and turning rooms for technical sessions provide plentiful opportunities for volunteers to interact with myriad members on a number of levels. Thus, it will be an overall positive experience for the volunteers. Quantitative needs are outlined in Appendix G.
