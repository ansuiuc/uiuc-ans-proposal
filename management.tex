$\textbf{General Co-Chair - Sam Dotson}$\\
Sam graduated with a B.S. in Physics from UIUC in 2019. He attended his first ANS student conference in April 2019 and was so inspired by his experience that he decided to pursue graduate work in nuclear engineering rather than physics. Now he does research on machine learning applications and computational reactor physics with Dr. Kathryn Huff in the ARFC group. Hosting a student conference that will inspire others the way he was inspired is one of his top priorities this year. He has experience planning activities for student organizations such as Guidance for Physics Students (GPS) and has experience fundraising for the College of Lake County (CLC). He helped set a record amount of donations at the 2016 CLC Foundation Gala, where he was an invited speaker and volunteer. He will be attending the ANS National conference in November 2019, as well as the ANS Student Conference 2020 at North Carolina State University.\\

$\textbf{Technical Co-Chair - Jeremy Mettler}$\\
Jeremy graduated with a B.S. in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering from UIUC in 2018, and is now attending as a 2nd-year graduate student studying plasma science under Dr. David Ruzic. He has been heavily involved in the UIUC student chapter of ANS since his freshman year, serving on the executive board for three years as External Vice President and President. Jeremy has attended the past five ANS Student Conferences, which serve as an inspiration for his involvement in this proposal process. He is dedicated to making sure that future generations of students are able to have the same amazing experiences through ANS as he had, especially at the ANS Student Conference. Outside of ANS, he has held a summer internship at Oak Ridge National Lab, and is currently focusing his research towards combined laser-plasma systems for materials processing.\\

$\textbf{Workshops Coordinator - Roberto Fairhurst}$\\
Roberto graduated with a B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Instituto Balseiro (Argentina) April 2018. He is now a 2nd-year graduate student at UIUC. He does research on computational multi-physics solvers applied to advanced reactors as part of the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycle group under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Huff. He got experience in the organization of conferences during the planning and development of a technical workshop (TWOFCS19) that took place at UIUC in June 2019. His motivation for hosting a student conference is his passion for Nuclear Energy and his desire to transmit this passion to other students. He believes hosting the student conference at UIUC will help the field grow and thrive. This is also an opportunity to meet other people working in the field, share life experiences, and develop a stronger network.

$\textbf{Logistics Chair - Natalie Gaughan}$\\
Natalie earned her B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2017. She has completed internships at Argonne National Laboratory and the International Atomic Energy Agency. She is now a graduate student at UIUC intending to research radiological science and nuclear medicine. Natalie has attended two ANS student conferences in the past and knows how these conferences can be influential in students’ career development. She will be attending the upcoming ANS student conference in 2020 at NC State.

Dilan Kurukulasuriay is a second-year undergraduate student pursuing a B.S. in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering, along with a minor in Physics and Mathematics. He has been active in ANS at UIUC since the start of his freshman year, and he currently serves as the Outreach Chair on the Executive Board. Dilan has worked at the Center for Plasma-Material Interactions lab since the start of his freshman year on HIDRA, and he stayed on campus over the summer to continue to do so. Dilan attended the 2019 ANS Student Conference and it was the highlight of his freshman year of college. He is interested in fusion science research, specifically the materials interaction aspect. He also plans on attending the upcoming student conference at NC State in 2020.

$\textbf{Media Coordinator - Nathan Ryan}$\\
Nathan is pursuing a B.S. in Physics from UIUC. He graduated in the top five of his high school class, while holding down a part time managerial position and running a research project at Argonne National Laboratory concurrent with his Sophomore through Senior years of Secondary Education. His first experience with Nuclear Physics was at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory where he worked with grad students on rare Cadmium isotopes. He has experience with building appealing website pages, as well as social media communications. He believes that an online presence for this event will supplement the success of an already great set of programs and individuals involved. He is excited to attend the upcoming ANS Student Conference at NC State in 2020.


[All committee members must plan on attending the upcoming student conference!]


\subsection{Conflict Resolution}

Committee members should hold professionalism at the forefront of their composure in order to avoid and resolve issues amicably without the involvement of higher powers. As such, members are encouraged to settle conflicts without invoking this protocol. If an issue arises that immediately presents itself as overwhelming, the scope of the issue exceeds an individual’s ability to handle it, or the issue imposes certain implications that jeopardizes the mission of the planning committee, members should not hesitate to refer to this section. In the event of a conflict between members of the planning committee, a document for decision-making and
conflict resolution has been drafted and approved by the general committee. All General Committee members
are expected to abide by the resolution. Key points of the resolution are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Subcommittees are encouraged to resolve conflicts internally and as democratically as possible. If an independent resolution cannot be reached, the Co-Chairs should be involved. The Co-Chairs have the final word on all decisions. If the Co-Chairs are unable to agree on a solution, the faculty advisor will be involved.
	\item Conflicts between individual committee members are to be resolved outside of the committee. Should such a conflict jeopradize the mission of the conference the Co-Chairs will be involved. 
	\item Any cases of misconduct or negligence will be handled appropriately by the Co-Chairs.
	\item For extreme cases of misconduct or negligence, separate steps for the removal and replacement of a
	member are outlined for general members, Subcommittee Chairs, and Co-Chairs. These include
	a discussion with the offending member, consultation of the Faculty Advisor, and a hearing with the
	General Committee to decide if removal is necessary.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Staffing Requirements}
Staffing for room breakdowns and setups, registration, socials, workshops, tours, etc.  will be supplied by either UIUC ANS members or students of the NPRE department. While it is likely that members of our student chapter will voluntarily fill all the staffing requirements of conference hosted events. If not, we will rely on other student organizations for support including, but not limited to: ACDIS and WIE. Participating in conference events on a staff level is a beneficial experience for any undergraduate who wants to become more familiar with ANS or support their ANS Chapter. Throughout the conference, interacting with registering students, driving groups to tour a scientific facility, and turning rooms for technical sessions provide plentiful opportunities for volunteers to interact with myriad members on a number of levels. Thus, it will be an overall positive experience for the volunteers. Quantitative needs are outlined in Appendix G.
