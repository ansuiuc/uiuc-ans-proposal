\section{Budget}


\subsection{Revenue}
We have compared the predicted and actual revenues from previous reports and used these to estimate our expected revenue. To maintain reasonable accuracy in the budget, we were financially conservative in our estimates to account for fluctuating economy and attendance numbers. Should our bid be selected, these conservative estimates will result in a smoother planning and execution process. We have also accounted an estimated number of waived professional registration based on previous conferences. This  correlates to the number of waived fees given in our expected tier sponsorship figures and also factors in discounts to speakers, panelists, and workshop instructors. \\

\subsection{Expenses}

\subsection{Sponsorship and Fundraising}
The sponsorship breakdown for our conference pulls from averages of sponsorship packages in the last several conferences, with for main tiers that tie into the conference theme for the largest representation in the conference and visibility in the career fair, socials, sessions, technical, and meals as well as in conference shirts and attendee bags. Using two tiers for an exhibitor package allows for a platform for DOE national laboratories to participate, with the higher tier having logo representation on shirts as well as the opportunity to sponsor a coffee break or lunch \& learn session. Lastly, two packages are left to benefactors who are recognized in the conference program and represent the anticipated support from ANS divisions or local industry or University of Illinois contributors (or some generous contributions from out-of-state companies!).

\subsection{Financial Contingency}

\subsection{Cost of Attendance and Student Reimbursement}
The cost of attending the student conference, per student, varies among schools and is highly dependent on distance from UIUC and the preferred mode of travel. We will assume that minimizing cost is a priority for schools, thus number of persons per hotel room is double the number of beds.
