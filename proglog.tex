Finding ways to encourage and include even one more person in the endeavor of nuclear science is an important kind of atomic contribution. This panel works toward the goal of celebrating the people behind the science. It also serves to inspire students and 

\subsubsection{Talking To Non-Scientists}
It has been shown that when members of the general public are given more scientific evidence they are less likely to shift their beliefs. While this finding is surprising to members of the scientific community, people who value data and evidence, it can be difficult to find ways to effectively communicate your research to the public. Attendees will learn how other scientists effectively communicate their results. No longer discouraged by potential resistance from the public, students will steel their resolve for working on ambitious projects that can save the world. Suzanne Hobbs Baker would be a great choice for this panel, as well as members of The Story Collider; a non-profit organization devoted to helping scientists tell stories that 

\subsubsection{How to Host a Conference}
This panel is devoted to sharing the experience of this conference's planning committee with students from other schools that may want to host their own student conference. This panel is for students by students. We will discuss our process from writing a successful proposal to executing a successful conference. 


\subsection{Workshops}

\subsubsection{Scientific Storytelling}
Science is people. The Story Collider is a non-profit organization whose mission is to honor the people and stories behind the science and teach scientists to use these stories to their advantage. From their website:
\begin{quote}
	We know that storytelling is not typically taught during scientific training, and is sometimes explicitly discouraged. There are many reasons why. But like it or not, stories are how people understand the world, and they weave together fact and emotion. Compared to other forms of communication, these narratives can be more successful in:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item generating interest and engagement with a topic,
		\item improving comprehension, and
		\item influencing real-world beliefs, even among skeptical audiences.
	\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Building Your Network}
The AAAS conducts workshops that teach early career scientists and students how to develop a professional network that will benefit them in the future. They hold regular workshops about strategic networking, making new contacts, and getting the most out of a conference. We will invite them to conduct a workshop where attendees can come away with skills to maximize their experience at the ANS Student Conference.

\subsubsection{MOOSE Workshop}
The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment is an open source framework for finite element modeling, developed and maintained by Idaho National Laboratory. MOOSE is a powerful framework that enables users to couple several different physics codes together under a single API. Many research groups at UIUC use this framework for simulating reactors and materials. The Idaho National Laboratory MOOSE team gives many workshops a year to train future user-developers of the framework. We will invite this team to give a half-day MOOSE workshop at the conference. The workshop will take place in NCSA room 1030.

\subsubsection{PyNE and PyRK Workshop}
Python for Nuclear Engineering (PyNE) and Python for Reactor Kinetics (PyRK) are two open source packages with computational tools for nuclear science and engineering. The PyNE toolkit provides both a Python and a C++ API for common computational pre- and post-processing tasks in nuclear engineering. PyRK offers point kinetics implementation for nuclear reactors. This workshop will provide a hands-on tutorial for attendees to begin using PyNE and make use of its capabilities for their curriculum and research work. The Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles (ARFC) research group at UIUC and its collaborators will provide instructors. This workshop, alpha-tested at the University of Wisconsin will be aimed at students who can provid their own laptops and have a desire to improve their nuclear computational skills. The workshop will be approximately two hours of instruction at NCSA room 1030.
