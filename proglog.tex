\subsection{Saving the World Panel Series}
Technical and non-technical panels encourage interaction between students and professionals at the conference. Each panel is designed to address one or more of the stated goals for the conference. They also serve as a way for students and professionals to learn more about relevant issues, find inspiration for their next project, and feel encouraged for the future of the nuclear field.\\
 
$\Large\textbf{Technical Panels}$

\subsubsection{Critical Conversations: Microreactors}
Microreactors are a growing area of nuclear research and the first installations have been projected for some time in the mid 2020s. They are capable of generating 1-50 MWth, which can be used directly or converted to electricity. These relatively portable reactors are capable of powering remote areas and towns with little infrastructure. UIUC has stated that it aims to be carbon neutral by 2050. The University is exploring the possibility of constructing a microreactor on campus for research and power generation, a first of its kind, in pursuit of its decarbonization goals. This panel will discuss the benefits and applications for microreactors around the world and also talk specifically about the potential market for microreactors on universities. We have a several groups on campus researching, simulating, and modelling microreactors. Faculty leading these groups such as Dr. Caleb Brooks and Dr. Kathryn Huff would be excellent speakers on this panel.


\subsubsection{Plasma Processing in Your Pocket}
Plasma processing has become a staple in many fields of advanced manufacturing. Without plasma, modern conveniences such as smartphones and powerful computer technology would not be possible. In this panel, representatives from companies at the cutting-edge of plasma processing research will discuss how plasmas continue to revolutionize contemporary industry. Potential panelists include Brian Jurczyk, CEO of Starfire Industries, and David Ruzic, Professor of NPRE and Principle Investigator of CPMI.

\subsubsection{Fusion: Materials for the Future}
Nuclear fusion has the potential to serve as the ultimate clean energy source, capable of supplying the world’s energy needs for millennia. Harnessing this immensely powerful energy resource requires further innovation in a variety of scientific disciplines. One of the largest remaining obstacles to fusion energy is the unprecedented strain placed on the materials from which fusion reactors are built. This panel will focus on the latest advancements in plasma facing components research and could feature panelists such as Professor Dan Andruczyk, director of the UIUC Center for Plasma-Material Interactions, and Dr. Lauren Garrison, Weinberg Fellow at ORNL.

\subsubsection{Nuclear Policy and Legislation}
Nuclear energy is one of the most heavily regulated fields in the United States. This panel aims to enlighten attendees about how legislation is written and how non-scientist government officials might better understand the potential of nuclear energy. This panel will allow attendees to learn who is working in this area and develop a network of people devoted to issues of nuclear policy. Leadership of the GAIN program would make excellent panelists to discuss policy.

\subsubsection{Radiological Techonology for a Healthier and Safer Future}
From the production of medical isotopes to nuclear verification, radiological engineering will play an important role in the future of health, security, and more. This panel will illuminate some of those applications and show attendees what could be possible with radiological technology. Speakers may include and Ross Radel from Phoenix and Professor DiFulvio from UIUC.\\

$\Large\textbf{Non-Technical Panels}$

\subsubsection{Science is People: Conducting Inclusive Research}
Research and technology that will help us solve the grand challenge problems of the world must also reflect the diverse needs of the people that live in it. Everyone comes to nuclear engineering from a variety of backgrounds, identities, abilities, and experiences. Saving the World One Atom at a Time means making atomic contributions. Finding ways to encourage and include even one more person in the endeavor of nuclear science is an important kind of atomic contribution. This panel works toward the goal of celebrating the people behind the science. It also serves to inspire students and professionals to consider how diversity plays a role in their research.

\subsubsection{Effective and Unorthodox Science Communication}
It has been shown that when members of the general public are given more scientific evidence they are less likely to shift their beliefs. While this finding is surprising to members of the scientific community, people who value data and evidence, it can be difficult to find ways to effectively communicate your research to the public. Professor Paul Kwiat of the Physics Department at UIUC has taken science communication in an entirely new direction. He owns and operates Lab Escape, a popular escape room in Urbana. Kwiat along with members of the Story Collider, non-profit organization devoted to helping scientists tell stories that will resonate with their audiences, would make an excellent panel on unusual methods of science communication.

\subsubsection{How to Host a Conference}
This panel is devoted to sharing the experience of this conference's planning committee with students from other schools that may want to host their own student conference. This panel is for students by students. Students from other schools will be able to ask questions and gain insights for their own conference hosting process.


\subsection{Workshops}

\subsubsection{Scientific Storytelling}
Science is people. The Story Collider is a non-profit organization whose mission is to honor the people and stories behind the science and teach scientists to use these stories to their advantage. From their website:
\begin{quote}
	We know that storytelling is not typically taught during scientific training, and is sometimes explicitly discouraged. There are many reasons why. But like it or not, stories are how people understand the world, and they weave together fact and emotion. Compared to other forms of communication, these narratives can be more successful in:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item generating interest and engagement with a topic,
		\item improving comprehension, and
		\item influencing real-world beliefs, even among skeptical audiences.
	\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Building Your Network}
The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conducts workshops that teach early career scientists and students how to develop a professional network that will benefit them in the future. They hold regular workshops about strategic networking, making new contacts, and getting the most out of a conference. We will invite them to conduct a workshop where attendees can come away with skills to maximize their experience at the ANS Student Conference.

\subsubsection{MOOSE Workshop}
The Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment is an open source framework for finite element modeling, developed and maintained by Idaho National Laboratory. MOOSE is a powerful framework that enables users to couple several different physics codes together under a single API. Many research groups at UIUC use this framework for simulating reactors and materials. The Idaho National Laboratory MOOSE team gives many workshops a year to train future user-developers of the framework. We will invite this team to give a half-day MOOSE workshop at the conference. The workshop will take place in NCSA room 1030.

\subsubsection{PyNE and PyRK Workshop}
Python for Nuclear Engineering (PyNE) and Python for Reactor Kinetics (PyRK) are two open source packages with computational tools for nuclear science and engineering. The PyNE toolkit provides both a Python and a C++ API for common computational pre- and post-processing tasks in nuclear engineering. PyRK offers point kinetics implementation for nuclear reactors. This workshop will provide a hands-on tutorial for attendees to begin using PyNE and make use of its capabilities for their curriculum and research work. The Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles (ARFC) research group at UIUC and its collaborators will provide instructors. This workshop, tested at the University of Wisconsin will be aimed at students who can provide their own laptops and have a desire to improve their nuclear computational skills. The workshop will be approximately two hours of instruction at NCSA room 1030.


\subsection{Technical Sessions}

Technical sessions are an integral part of every student conference. This is where students can share their research experiences, new ideas, exchange knowledge, and \textit{atomic contributions} to the big problems of the world. There are 6 technical sessions held concurrently each day. Each room will be equipped with a projectors, computers, podiums, and other necessary equipment. Each presenter is given 15 minutes to present and 5 minutes to answer questions from the audience. Presenters will be judged on significance, originality, and overall presentation (Podium Presentation Judging Form can be found in Appendix B). The divisions of the technical sessions include, but are not limited to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Accelerator Applications

\subsection{Poster Session}
There will be a poster session on Saturday in Illini Room C and the South Lounge. This offers nearly 1600 square feet of space and allows students an opportunity to share their research in an open environment. The poster session will be immediately adjacent to the career fair. This encourages students and professionals, that might otherwise go to one or neither, to attend both. There will be an award for best graduate and undergraduate poster. A layout of the rooms are available in Appendix D: Building Layout.

\subsubsection{Highschool Poster Session}
We believe that attracting younger students to the field of nuclear engineering will help us grow the nuclear community. To that end we will invite high school students to present a poster on a topic of interest in the nuclear sciences. This will also add to the diversity of the conference.

\subsection{Career Fair}
The career will be held all day on Friday, from 8am to 5pm, and on Saturday from 8am to noon. It will be held in Illini Rooms A \& B, a large space capable of holding 600 people. This space will be immediately adjacent to the poster sessions on saturday to encourage students and professionals to attend both. Together, the Illini Rooms can hold up to 900 people. Recruiters can mail bulkier items prior to their arrival in Champaign. All companies that sponsor the conference will be given a table at the career fair. Location will be decided in order of sponsorship amount and when the agreement was made. Universities may freely request a table at the career fair, while space is available.
