Prof. Slaybaugh's research is based in numerical methods for neutron transport with an emphasis on supercomputing. She applies these methods to reactor design, shielding, and nuclear security and nonproliferation. Slaybaugh was a key founder of the nuclear innovation bootcamp, which seeks to train students and professionals in skills essential to innovation in nuclear energy while executing team projects. Finally, Slaybaugh has served as a Program Director at ARPA-E, developing and running their first fission energy programs. Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) invests in research for ways to generate, use, and store energy. These projects have the potential to radically improve economic prosperity in the U.S. and environmental wellbeing. Due to her endeavors in teaching and sharing nuclear innovation, we believe that Slaybaugh's goals are aligned with the goals of this conference and would make her an excellent addition to the program. Slaybaugh has much to offer the conference with her vision and leadership.

$\Large\textbf{Non-Technical Panels}$

\subsubsection{Science is People: Conducting Inclusive Research}
Research and technology that will help us solve the grand challenge problems of the world must also reflect the diverse needs of the people that live in it. Everyone comes to nuclear engineering from a variety of backgrounds, identities, abilities, and experiences. Saving the World One Atom at a Time means making atomic contributions. Finding ways to encourage and include even one more person in the endeavor of nuclear science is an important kind of atomic contribution. This panel works toward the goal of celebrating the people behind the science. It also serves to inspire students and 

\subsubsection{Talking To Non-Scientists}
It has been shown that when members of the general public are given more scientific evidence they are less likely to shift their beliefs. While this finding is surprising to members of the scientific community, people who value data and evidence, it can be difficult to find ways to effectively communicate your research to the public. Attendees will learn how other scientists effectively communicate their results. No longer discouraged by potential resistance from the public, students will steel their resolve for working on ambitious projects that can save the world. Suzanne Hobbs Baker would be a great choice for this panel, as well as members of The Story Collider; a non-profit organization devoted to helping scientists tell stories 




\subsubsection{How to Host a Conference}

\subsection{Workshops}

\subsubsection{Scientific Storytelling}
Science is people. The Story Collider is a non-profit organization whose mission is to honor the people and stories behind the science and teach scientists to use these stories to their advantage. From their website:
\begin{quote}
	We know that storytelling is not typically taught during scientific training, and is sometimes explicitly discouraged. There are many reasons why. But like it or not, stories are how people understand the world, and they weave together fact and emotion. Compared to other forms of communication, these narratives can be more successful in:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item generating interest and engagement with a topic,
		\item improving comprehension, and
		\item influencing real-world beliefs, even among skeptical audiences.
	\end{itemize}
