	$\textbf{General Co-Chair - Sam Dotson}$\\
Sam graduated with a B.S. in Physics from UIUC in 2019. He attended his first ANS student conference in April 2019 and was so inspired by his experience that he decided to pursue graduate work in nuclear engineering rather than physics. Now he does research on machine learning applications and computational reactor physics with Dr. Kathryn Huff in the ARFC group. Hosting a student conference that will inspire others the way he was inspired is one of his top priorities this year. He has experience planning activities for student organizations such as Guidance for Physics Students (GPS) and has experience fundraising for the College of Lake County (CLC).

Jeremy graduated with a B.S. in Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering from UIUC in 2018, and is now attending as a 3rd-year graduate student studying plasma science under Dr. David Ruzic. He has been heavily involved in the UIUC student chapter of ANS since his freshman year, serving on the executive board for three years as External Vice President and President. Jeremy has attended the past five ANS Student Conferences, which serve as an inspiration for his involvement in this proposal process. He is dedicated to making sure that future generations of students are able to have the same amazing experiences through ANS as he had, especially at the ANS Student Conference. Outside of ANS, he has held a summer internship at Oak Ridge National Lab, and is currently focusing his research towards combined laser-plasma systems for materials processing.

Roberto graduated with a B.S. in Nuclear Engineering from Instituto Balseiro (Argentina) April 2018. He is now a 3rd-year graduate student at UIUC. He does research on computational multi-physics solvers applied to advanced reactors as part of the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycle group under the supervision of Dr. Kathryn Huff. He got experience in the organization of conferences during the planning and development of a technical workshop (TWOFCS19) that took place at UIUC in June 2019. His motivation for hosting a student conference is his passion for Nuclear Energy and his desire to transmit this passion to other students. He believes hosting the student conference at UIUC will help the field grow and thrive. This is also an opportunity to meet other people working in the field, share life experiences, and develop a stronger network.

He has been involved with the ANS-UIUC since his freshman year and has dedicated his time to outreach events and increasing public awareness of nuclear science and nuclear energy. He has accomplished this through events such as UIUC's Engineering Open House. It was an event he enjoyed as a kid and hopes to help other children develop an interest in nuclear sciences. He also returns to his high school to talk about his experience at UIUC. He looks forward to learning more about nuclear fission technology and to make advancements in nuclear science and in the nuclear energy sector as a whole. He looks forward to attending the student conference at NC State in 2020.
